  "when": "<date or time reference, if any>",
  "impact": "<Short descipion of results e.g what was destroyed, if people were injured etc., if any>",
  "tweet_text": "<put here original message>"
}

If it is NOT about flooding, reply with JSON exactly matching this schema:
{
  "is_flood": false,
  "reason": "<why you think itâ€™s not about flooding>",
  "tweet_text": "<put here original message>"
}

Return ONLY JSON. No additional text!
