# Description of project

Project that uses AI models as element of ETL process.

# Setup

All steps needs to be done to work on project.

# Python

1. In folder "Server_source" run: 'python3 -m venv .venv'
2. Enter it with 'source ./Server_source/.venv/bin/activate' 
3. then run 'pip install -r ./Server_source/requirements.txt'
4. VS code might still have a problem with picking 'python.defaultInterpreterPath' to this './Server_source/.venv/bin/activate' because it did not exist. Try exit VS code and start it from main folder again. It should work.
